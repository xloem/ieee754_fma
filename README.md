# ieee754_fma

This is a toy maybe-someday-useful project toward calculating fused multiply
add via direct access of the bits of floating point values.

The work started as changes to small parts of https://half.sourceforge.net/
which is MIT licensed.

I did not use reference material while starting this, so it's not strictly
compliant [yet?].

The use of half/half.hpp is just for testing. The function is standalone.
